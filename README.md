# Creating a ReadMe.md Generator

## Description: 
I've created a readMe generator which would makes it easy for users to simply response to some questions and the app will create a new markdown file with readMe information. This app will limit the User's stress from having to type a readMe all from scratch. This application will be using Node.js so Users will be running code on the command-line.

To view some examples, you can check DemoReadMe.md.
