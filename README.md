# Creating a ReadMe.md Generator

## Description: 
I've created a readMe generator which would makes it easy for users to simply response to some questions and the app will create a new markdown file with readMe information. This app will limit the User's stress from having to type a readMe all from scratch. This application will be using Node.js so Users will be running code on the command-line.

To view some examples, you can check `DemoReadMe.md` in my repositories.

## Installation:
To create this application, you would have to run `npm install` which will provide you a npm dependencies such as `node_modules` & `package.json`. However, if users only need to install `package.json` they can run `npm init -y` on the command-line.
 - `inquirer` will capture user response in the commmand-line.

## Usage:
A video demo of how this application operates.
